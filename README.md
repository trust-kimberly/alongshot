# A Long Shot

In order to graduate, every Rhode Island School of Design MFA grad is required to complete and submit to the library a physical book or multimedia work presenting their graduate thesis. Inevitably, the pandemic changed these longstanding requirements. 

With a month's worth of coding knowledge, I built a digital home for my writing.

This repository was just the beginning. The completed work lives here: http://alongshot.xyz/
